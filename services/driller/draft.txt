Global Driller

Default admin account: GlobalDrillerCompany/demo
Create an account (non-admin): Account name, password (SHA-1'ed with a salt), (ID, creator ID)

Vulnerabilities:
# Default admin account
# Backdoor account: If the prefix is "ILoveCat", then it will become an admin
# Password comparison: Only compares the first unsigned char
# Identity check is lame. (0 means normal user, otherwise are admins)
# Pointer overwritten. Global drilling count has an overlap with the global user pointer (they are all static). Global user vector pointer could be rewritten to global spot vector pointer
