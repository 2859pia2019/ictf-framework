If the VMs are hosted by you (the organizers), make sure that you have a
dedicated route to your VMs. For instance, if you can reach your vulnerable VMs
via eth0:
    TEAMS="<a list of space separated teams you have>"
    for TEAMID in ${TEAMS}; do
        route add 10.7.${TEAMID}.2 dev eth1
    done
Otherwise the concentrator will try to reach them via the team's router, which
will fail if you host them.

If the teams host the vulnerable boxes themselves, you need to add the following
line to the ictf-in-a-box.conf (OpenVPN configuration file):
    client-to-client
