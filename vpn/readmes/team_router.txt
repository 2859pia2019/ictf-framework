The following IPs are reserved by the infrastructure:
    10.7.YOUR_TEAM_ID.1         <- this is your VPN IP
    10.7.YOUR_TEAM_ID.2         <- this is your vuln box
    10.7.YOUR_TEAM_ID.3         <- this is your locally reachable IP
    10.7.YOUR_TEAM_ID.254       <- this is your VPN point-to-point

Generally, the route to the game network is (should be pushed automatically)
    route add -net 10.7.0.0/16 gw 10.0.TEAM.254

If the vulnerable box is hosted by the organizers, you need to add:
    route add 10.7.YOUR_TEAM_ID.2 gw 10.0.YOUR_TEAM_ID.254

If it is hosted by you, you don't need to do anything.

Your clients/players should add a route to 10.0.0.0/16 through gateway
10.7.YOUR_TEAM_ID.3 to reach the game network:
    route add -net 10.7.0.0/16 gw 10.0.YOUR_TEAM_ID.3
